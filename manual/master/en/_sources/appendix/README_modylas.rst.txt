MODYLAS
=======

SUMMARY
-------

MODYLAS is a highly parallelized general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation program appropriate for very large physical, chemical, and
biological systems. It is equipped with most standard MD techniques including
free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration method.
Long-range forces are evaluated rigorously by the fast multipole method
(FMM) without using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in order to realize
excellent scalability. The program enables investigations of large-scale
real systems such as viruses, liposomes, assemblies of proteins and
micelles, and polymers. It works on ordinary linux machines, too.
