DCore
=====

SUMMARY
-------

A tool for performing quantum many-body simulations based on dynamical
mean-field theory. In addition to predefined models, one can construct
and solve an ab-initio tight-binding model by using wannier 90 or
RESPACK. We provide a post-processing tool for computing physical
quantities such as the density of state and the momentum resolved
spectral function. DCore depends on external libraries such as TRIQS and
ALPSCore.
