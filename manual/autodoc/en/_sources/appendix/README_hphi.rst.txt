:math:`{\rm H}\Phi`
=====================

SUMMARY
-------

An exact diagonalization package for a wide range of quantum lattice
models (e.g. multi-orbital Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo
lattice model). :math:`{\rm H}\Phi` also supports the massively parallel computations.
The Lanczos algorithm for obtaining the ground state and thermal pure
quantum state method for finite-temperature calculations are
implemented. In addition, dynamical Green’s functions can be calculated
using , :math:`{\rm K}\omega` which is a library of the shifted Krylov subspace method. It
is possible to perform simulations for real-time evolution from ver.
3.0.
