SUMMARY
-------

A low-energy solver for a wide ranger of quantum lattice models
(multi-orbital Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo-lattice model) by
using variational Monte Carlo method. User can obtain high-accuracy wave
functions for ground states of above models. Users flexibly choose the
correlation factors in wavefunctions such as Gutzwiller, Jastrow, and
doublon-holon binding factors and optimize more the ten thousand
variational parameters. It is also possible to obtain the low-energy
excited states by specifying the quantum number using the quantum number
projection.
