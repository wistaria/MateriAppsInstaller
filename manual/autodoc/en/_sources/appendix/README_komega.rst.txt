:math:`{\rm K}\omega`
========================

SUMMARY
-------

:math:`{\rm K}\omega` implements large-scale parallel computing of the shifted Krylov
subspace method. Using :math:`{\rm K}\omega`, dynamical correlation functions can be
efficiently calculated. This application includes a mini-application for
calculating dynamical correlation functions of quantum lattice models
such as the Hubbard model, the Kondo model, and the Heisenberg model in
combination with the quantum lattice solver of quantum many-body
problems,
