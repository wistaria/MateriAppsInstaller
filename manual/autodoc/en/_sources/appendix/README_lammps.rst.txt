SUMMARY
-------

A general-purpose open-source application for classical molecular
dynamics simulation, distributed under the GPL license. This package can
perform molecular dynamics calculation of various systems such as soft
matters, solids, and mesoscopic systems. It can be used as a simulator
of classical dynamics of realistic atoms as well as general model
particles. It supports parallel computing through spatial divisions. Its
codes are designed so that their modification and extension are easy.
