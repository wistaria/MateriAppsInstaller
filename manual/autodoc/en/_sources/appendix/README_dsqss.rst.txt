DSQSS
=====

SUMMARY
-------

DSQSS is an application program for solving quantum many body problems
in a discrete set (typically a lattice). It carries out quantum Monte
Carlo simulations that sample from the Feynman path integral using the
worm update. It can handle any lattice geometry and interaction.
