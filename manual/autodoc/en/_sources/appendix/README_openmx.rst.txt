OpenMX
======

SUMMARY
-------

OpenMX is a first-principles software based on the pseudo-atomic
localized basis functions. It calculates electronic structure rapidly
for a wide range of materials including crystals, interfaces, liquids,
etc. It speedily provides molecular dynamics simulation and structural
optimization of large-scale systems and also implements a hybrid
parallelism. It is able to deal with non-collinear magnetism and
non-equilibrium Greenâ€™s function calculations for electrical
conductions.
