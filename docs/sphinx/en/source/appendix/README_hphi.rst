HΦ

SUMMARY
-------

An exact diagonalization package for a wide range of quantum lattice
models (e.g. multi-orbital Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo
lattice model). HΦ also supports the massively parallel computations.
The Lanczos algorithm for obtaining the ground state and thermal pure
quantum state method for finite-temperature calculations are
implemented. In addition, dynamical Green’s functions can be calculated
using , Kω which is a library of the shifted Krylov subspace method. It
is possible to perform simulations for real-time evolution from ver.
3.0.
