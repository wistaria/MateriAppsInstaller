RESPACK
=======

SUMMARY
-------

RESPACK is a first-principles calculation software for evaluating the
interaction parameters of materials. It is able to calculate the
maximally localized Wannier functions, the RPA response functions, and
frequency-dependent electronic interaction parameters. RESPACK receives
its input data from a band calculation using norm-conserving
pseudopotentials with plane-wave basis sets. Utilities which convert a
result of xTAPP or Quantum ESPRESSO to input for RESPACK are
prepared. The software has been used successfully for a wide range of
materials such as metals, semiconductors, transition-metal compounds,
and organic compounds. It supports OpenMP / MPI parallelization.
