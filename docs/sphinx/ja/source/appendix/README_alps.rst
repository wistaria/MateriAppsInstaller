ALPS
====

SUMMARY
-------

ALPS is a numerical simulation library for strongly correlated systems
such as magnetic materials or correlated electrons. It contains
typicalsolvers for strongly correlated systems: Monte Carlo methods,
exact diagonalization, the density matrix renormalization group, etc. It
can be used to calculate heat capacities, susceptibilities,
magnetization processes in interacting spin systems, the density of
states in strongly correlated electrons, etc. A highly efficient
scheduler for parallel computing is another improvement.
