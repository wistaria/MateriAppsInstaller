# DSQSS 

## SUMMARY 

 DSQSS is an application program for solving quantum many body problems in a discrete set (typically a lattice). It carries out quantum Monte Carlo simulations that sample from the Feynman path integral using the worm update. It can handle any lattice geometry and interaction.
