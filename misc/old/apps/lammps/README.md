# LAMMPS 

## SUMMARY 

 A general-purpose open-source application for classical molecular dynamics simulation, distributed under the GPL license. This package can perform molecular dynamics calculation of various systems such as soft matters, solids, and mesoscopic systems. It can be used as a simulator of classical dynamics of realistic atoms as well as general model particles. It supports parallel computing through spatial divisions. Its codes are designed so that their modification and extension are easy.
